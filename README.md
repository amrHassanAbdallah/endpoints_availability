# endpoints_availability


#### Breif: 
This repo act as server simulator , by exposing 2 endpoints , one that return fast response and different
 random response status , and another that returns slow (delayed) response with random response status too .
 In order to allow [Health checker](https://github.com/amrHassanAbdallah/site_health_checker)  to work with different cases .
